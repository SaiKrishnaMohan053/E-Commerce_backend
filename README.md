## Core Logic Overview

### Flavored Products
- Support per-flavor price, stock, sold count
- If all prices same: store once in `product.price`
- If prices vary: flavor-wise pricing is used

### Stock Management
- Flavored: stock per flavor name
- Non-flavored: `stock` field at product level

### Deals & Discounts
- `isDeal`: toggle deal mode
- `discountType`: `percent` or `fixed`
- `discountValue`: computed on frontend based on base price

### Image Handling
- `multer.memoryStorage()` for file uploads
- `uploadToS3()` and `deleteFromS3()` for AWS S3

### Cart Logic
- Cart document linked to user (one-to-one)
- Item uniqueness based on `productId` and optional `flavor`
- Automatically creates cart if none exists
- Handles quantity updates, item removal, and full cart clearing
